CS-255-T3295 System Analysis and Design 

Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The clent is DriverPass: company to take advantage of a void in the market when it comes to training students for the driving test at their 
local department of motor vehicles (DMV).
System to provide customers with ability to take online classes and practice tests. The company will also provide customers with on-the-road training if they wish. Customers to access to the system online from any computer or mobile device. 

What did you do particularly well?

In all honesty and being my own worst critic, I don't think I did any one thing particularly well. I did well overall in the course, but I can't pick out any one thing I did better than any other. If I could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, I would probably revise just about everything. I needed to spend more quality time on the projects. Unfortunately, school takes a backseat to my job and family commitments. I tried to the best work with the time available but, I think I could have produced better work if I had put some more time into it.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

Without being able to actually dicuss the user's needs with hte people from DriverPass, I had to interpret those from the DriverPass interview Transcriot provided in the course. I tried to put myself in the position of the client and their employees and also in the position of what a customer might be looking for. There would need to be a lot more work done to complete the full list of business requirements and flesh out the functional and non-functional requirements.

In a real situation , if you don't consider the usre's needs when designing a system, you will most likely fail miserably in creating one that is successful. The user is the one who will be 'using' the system. If you don't take them into account when designing it, then it probably won't meet their needs when it's completed.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

I would have several meetings with the customer, the requirements team, and some people from the coding and testing teams to determine exactly what the system is supposed to do and what the customer wants to accomlish. Then have the requiremsnts team, coders and testers get together to determine what requiremnts need to be to build the system. Once requirements are complete, this team will present them to the customer's representatives and get a sign off. Then the coders create the code to build the system and the testers create the tests from the requirements to make sure the system does what it is supposed to do and try to find ways to 'break it'. Once the coders have completed their coding and testing their code, then the testers system test the code, dicsussing issues with the coders and traking defects. I personally think it is important to get the coders and testers working together during the coding and testing phase to eliminate some of the adversariale relationships that often come between the two groups. I feel you get a better product when the two groups work together and the coders don't feel the need to 'deend' their code.
